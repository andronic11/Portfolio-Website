            <p id= "About">I'm a driven 20-year-old student at Michigan State University pursuing a Dual Bachelor's of Science Degree in 
                Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Business. I'm highly passionate about three things: problem solving,
                collaboration, and education. I currently work as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant at MSU, teaching 
                PHY 183: Physics for Scientists and Engineers. In this role I have been able to utilize my passionate
                for project management, serving as a leader and resource as students solve challenging real world physics projects
                weekly. Along with this I have been able to utilize and develop my experience as a computer scientist,
                using python as a tool to model and analyze these various projects.
