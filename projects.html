            <h3>This Website!</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Creating this website was a project within itself centered around developing and utilizing my
                    skills with HTML, CSS, and Github. The goal was to create a clean but professional profile
                    that could highlight information about myself and my career. Since this was my first major project
                    using these tools, I had my fair share of roadbumps. I ran into issues with a remote repository on GitHub, 
                    where the main branch was corrupted or had broken references. While this was initially intimidating, I researched 
                    the problem and, with some perseverance, learned how to create a temporary branch to preserve my changes, delete the
                    problematic main branch, and then recreate it to restore the repository's integrity. This experience
                    treamoundously grew my confidence using the terminal to handle issues in GitHub. I plan to incorporate
                    what I have learned into my next projects on GitHub. I also plan to refine this sight as I continue
                    to hone my capabilities with HTML, CSS, and soon JavaScript.
