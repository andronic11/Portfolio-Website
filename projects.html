                    Creating this website was a project in itself, centered around developing and utilizing my skills with HTML, CSS, and GitHub.
                     The goal was to create a clean but professional profile that could highlight information about myself and my career. I also wanted 
                     to ensure it was optimized for mobile devices so that I could display it easily to others. Since this was my first major project using 
                     these web development tools, I had my fair share of roadblocks. The main issue I faced came from a difficulty with a remote repository on GitHub, where the 
                     main branch was corrupted or had broken references. While this was initially intimidating, I researched the problem and, with some perseverance, 
                     learned how to create a temporary branch to preserve my changes, delete the problematic main branch, and then recreate it to restore the repository's integrity. 
                     This experience tremendously grew my confidence using the terminal to handle issues in GitHub and my ability to use the platform as a whole. 
                     I plan to incorporate what I have learned from this experience into my next projects on GitHub. I also plan to refine this site as 
                     I continue to hone my capabilities with HTML, CSS, and soon JavaScript
